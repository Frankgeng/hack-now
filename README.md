## General Work Flow

To keep things organized, we're going to work with feature branches. This will allow us to clearly divide separate features and rollback whenever necessary. Our branch naming convention is <your_name>/<feature_name> for example, ricky/webscraping.

1. Create a new branch

```
git checkout -b <your_name>/<feature_name>
```

2. Make your code changes

3. Add your changes

```
git add <filename>
```

4. Commit your changes

```
git commit "This is a descriptive message about your changes"
```

3. Push your branch to github

```
git push
```
